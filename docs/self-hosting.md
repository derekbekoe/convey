# Self-hosting

For convenience, we've provided a service that the application uses by default.

Alternatively, you can host your own [NATS Streaming Server](https://docs.nats.io/nats-streaming-concepts/intro) and configure `convey` to use that server.

Some of these methods require using the `convey` `--unsecure` flag. Only use this flag for experimental or development purposes only. We only include these methods as an illustration as traffic to the server is not encrypted. Typically, you should [encrypt connections with TLS](https://docs.nats.io/developing-with-nats/security/tls).

## Host Local Docker container (no TLS)

Start NATS Streaming service as a Docker container:

```sh
docker run -p 4222:4222 nats-streaming:linux
```

Configure `convey` to use this server:

```
convey configure --nats-url nats://localhost:4222 --nats-cluster test-cluster
```

Note: You will need to use the `--unsecure` flag as TLS will not be enabled through this local container.

## Host on Azure Container Instances (no TLS)

Create a resource group and create the container:
```sh
az group create -n nats -l westus
az container create --image nats-streaming:linux --location westus --command-line "/nats-streaming-server -cid test-cluster -mc 0 -ma 30m -mi 10m -D" -g nats -n nats-container --ports 4222 --ip-address Public
```

For the meaning of the `--command-line` arguments, see [NATS Streaming Server - Command Line Arguments](https://docs.nats.io/nats-streaming-server/configuring/cmdline).

Get the IP address of the container and use it below.

Configure `convey` to use this server:

```
convey configure --nats-url nats://IP_ADDRESS:4222 --nats-cluster test-cluster
```

Note: You will need to use the `--unsecure` flag as TLS will not be enabled through this local container.

## Host Local Docker container with self-signed cert (TLS)

*The below steps to generate the certificates were adapted from this blog post: https://itnext.io/secure-pub-sub-with-nats-fcda983d0612*

In order to secure our NATS server, we will create a self-signed cert and we will sign this certificate with our own self-signed Certification Authority. If you are familiar with this and can create your own certificates, you can skip this part.

Download `cfssl` and `cfssljson` from https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases.

Prepare some files for `cfssl`:

```sh
echo '
{
  "CN": "Convey self-signed CA",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "O": "Convey CA",
      "L": "Portland",
      "ST": "Oregon",
      "C": "US"
    }
  ]
}' > ca.json
```

```sh
echo '
{
  "signing": {
    "default": {
      "expiry": "43800h"
    },
    "profiles": {   
      "server": {
        "expiry": "43800h",
        "usages": [
          "signing",
          "digital signing",
          "key encipherment",
          "server auth"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}' > config.json
```

```sh
echo '{
    "CN": "Server",
    "hosts": [
        "127.0.0.1"
    ]
}' > server.json
```

Generate the certificates:

```sh
cfssl gencert -initca ca.json | cfssljson -bare ca
cfssl gencert -ca=ca.pem -ca-key=ca-key.pem -config=config.json -profile=server server.json | cfssljson -bare server
```

Start the NATS Streaming server:

```sh
docker run -p 4222:4222 -v $(pwd):/certs nats-streaming:linux -mc 0 -tls_client_cacert /certs/ca.pem --encrypt --encryption_key mykey --tlscert /certs/server.pem --tlskey /certs/server-key.pem --tls
```

Where `$(pwd)` is the directory that contains all the created certificates.

Finally, configure `convey` to use this server:

<!-- TODO-DEREK Verify it works without --unsecure -->
```
convey configure --nats-url nats://localhost:4222 --nats-cluster test-cluster
```

If you want to host on a VM instead, it should be fairly straightforward to modify the above and configure `convey` to point to the correct IP or hostname.

## Host on VM with certificate signed by CA (TLS)

TODO-DEREK Complete this using Lets Encrypt.
